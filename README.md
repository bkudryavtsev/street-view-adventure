# Street View Adventure
A web-based geography guessing game inspired by [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) with account-less multiplayer. Players are placed in a semi-random Street View location and are required to guess their as many locations as they can by looking for clues in the interactive panorama before the time runs out.
