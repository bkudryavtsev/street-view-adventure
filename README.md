# Street View Adventure
A web-based geography guessing game inspired by [GeoGuessr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGuessr) with account-less multiplayer and (virtually) unlimited locations. Players are placed in a semi-random Street View location and are required to guess as many locations as they can by looking for clues in the interactive panorama before the time runs out.
